# python_web_app
Web app created with online tutorial using Python3 and Flask

UPDATE 8/3/21
Begin project. Worked through the first 3 chapters learning Python and Flask to create a microblog web app.
Created a Sign In form, and an Index page with a couple of hard coded posts to show formatting.
Next steps will be based upon the progression of the tutorial, and this repo will be updated to reflect changes.
